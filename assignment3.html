            <h2>Nesting objects </h2>
            <h3> This process went pretty well. I was able to pretty easily make simple geometry and adjust the spacing between them. I got some extra help of bringing Geometry from 
              Grasshopper. I attempted to use a frog cut out and It didn't seem to be working. Junchau helped me figure out that it was an issue of getting too big or small. I realized the t
              were too small to really do a good nest with.

       <h2>Clip Tree </h2>
      <h3> I definetly appreciated using Grasshopper for this assignment. It made it much easier to iterate. First I worked on getting the sizing just right. Then I realized that an even number of inserts would work better for design. 
I also added a frog to one of the gears, but it did not make it onto the final design as their was not quite space for that design. After getting my clips to be able to clip to my cardboard I did a quick laser print of some leaves to build a tree. My cardboard was pretty thick and didnt print all the way
through the first time. I had it at full power and tried adjusting speed. I ended up printing twice through. I was able to make 2 trees with my ten clips.</h3>
