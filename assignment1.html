            <h2>The Flower </h2>
            <h3>Is this updating!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was my first cookie cutter design! In my first attemps I had some ugly cross over that did not become apparent until I pulled it into Rhino. I went back and fixed it in Adobe Illustrator and come up with something much more effective! I also did some experimenting in Rhino and attempted to add a band to aid in picking up the cutter, as well as
            experimenting with text. I figured it would need to be reverse to be the correct way facing up. This will definetly be an experiment! PC:d_hibiscus_blank_background_by_paradasia-d3c01cr.png (900Ã—648) (wixmp.com)

 <h2>The Fish</h2>
            <h3>This is a picture I took of a really cool rigger Fish ceramic. I thought the outline looked nice and might make for a tropical cookie! 
                on this one was how to edit the picture to remove some of those strong defined lines, and then having to reinvent the lips. I also forgot to switch to no fill when I first imported to Rhino, but that was a quick fix!
