            <h2>Converting Learnings to Middle School Projects </h2>
      <h3>For my final project I choose to adjust our learnings into projects that could be done at the middle school level. I wanted to find a modeling program that would work with kids
      and create a few projects using the skills learned in this class. I decided that I would create a kids version of the casting and molding project and that I would do some mesh editing to create a project where students created add-ons to a robot they
      would be able to program. I made so me adjustments after feedback to the original project proposal after feedback to simplify the project. The full proposal with updates can be found in the previous assignment. </h3>

<h4> Interation Lamp </h4>

<h3>The first part of this project entailed finding a kid friendly CAD or modeling program. I thought TynkerCad which I have created a model with would work, but I found that the meshes it exports are 
have a lot of issues. This fueld my search to find an easy to use modeling program. I ended up decideding on 3D Builder which seemed to be most consistant in exporting out printable meshes. Below you can see the modeling programs I looked at. </h3>

<h2> Modeling Programs I tried creating molds and exporting moldes with.  </h2>

<h2> Making my mold with 3D builder </h2>
<h3> Building a mold in 3D builder was actually quite easy . Within the insert section it all has all the basic necessary edits that I had needed to be able to get measurements, Boolean difference, in ways for me to build out the wall . I was also able to experiment, and I learned that I could also do splits so it would be a great program to do a two part mold in as well so I could do a two part candle mold within paint 3D as well. I decided to make a heart sheet mold, and I decided that it made sense to do just one mold rather than a full tray because that would take up both more time to print an more materials which went planning for an entire class project definitely want to limit that . So I decided to make a heart shape either ice maker mold or soap mold and for my own product I decided to make soup because I didn't have food safe oomoo. I was really excited when it exported a great mesh and I got it printing. I was able to make my silicone mold successfully and pull it out. I then bought the base for soap, added some essential oils, and dried Flowers to my mold. I was able to successfully finish my soap models, and have concluded that this would be a great activity even down to the 4th grade level. 3D builder was quite easy to use all you needed to do was create a box then take the difference with another box Ann you had the walls of the tray then I was able to create my heart model inside get that leveled right and then I was able to remove any pieces that were hanging off the edge with some of the split components. I think there could be a lot of flexibility in what students create in simple ways and we got them to think about what are they going to be able to pull out and just work through the workflow of making a mold for mold and what that should look like. I'm really excited to do it with kids. I also love my soap!</h3>

 <h2>Brain Hurts </h2>
            <p> <h3>  This project is proving to be a true challenge for me. It really hightlights my inexperience in Rhino as I struggle to get, what feel like basic
components doing what I want. I decided that I wanted to make a candle mold that would make candles for my fire place candlabra. I wanted to add some mountains to it for a personal touch.
However, after measuring my size needs and getting in the base cylider that getting the mountains to extrude on the candle would be challeninging. I started in Illustrator to get my moutain vector. I tried follwoing along with the riboon video
but was not doing things quite right. I experimented with a number of things for a few hours and tried googling to kow avail. I didn't know what words to search. Thankfully we have the best
TA who aggreed to schedule a time to work on it with me. </h3> </p>

<p> I got a lot of help from Junchau both in getting the curve working and the wrapping my brain around how to make a mold, for a mold. He gave me a bunch of tips and ways to move things around
    which has been so helpful!I lost a my main candle mold, but thankfully we were able to make the the negatives I had created to make a mold. I first had created what my silicon mold should look like, instead of the mold to make it. I am going to print
    each mold half of a difreant printer to get it done on time. My school has a rule where we can't leave the printer running if no one is in the building. </p>
                <p> When I started my print I got a horrible sound from my printer as it tried to hone. I figured out that my Prusa gets unhappy about honeing if it is left at its highest postiion. I 
                    could adjust the y and it was good to go. </p>

<h3> Well I printed my molds at school, but quickly realized one my molds in is the negative, not the positive of what I wanted :( . Brain hurt!!! I can't fix it at work, but will work to fix it tomomrow after work. I believe I understand what I need
    to do to fix it, which is exciting. It means I am learning!!!</h2> </div>
