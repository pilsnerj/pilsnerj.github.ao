              <ol>
                <li>My first task of creating the initial model proved to be quite challenging as I mentioned in the previous assignment. Once I got the mold created off of that 
                I thought it would be smooth sailing. I was wrong.</li>
                 <li> This week I went battle trying to figure out why, when I created a model it was printing concave instead convex as it looked in my model. I could tell in the slicer
                that I had some issues, but I thought I had them in the one that printed correctly and it still looked convex. Alas, it kept printing concave and I had one print that just couldn not be printed. 
                I got a 3D printer monster.</li>
                 <li> Eventually (after hours of tinkering) I got help from Junchau. He was able to quickly see I had some missalignment in one of the corners. He tought me a bout ctrl+shift recently which
                has changed my Rhino life. With his help I was able to close the shape and learned a lot more about how to use Rhino. Finally, it printed correctly. </li>
                 <li> I was able to successfully stir and pour my Oomoo without to much trouble. I let it set and was able to shake out my molds.</li>
                <li> I was nervous for pouring the the hot wax, I was afraid that it would still pout out the sides. It went okay with the help of an extra hand. It was a bit challenging 
                getting the candle string in, but I used the extra vent place to help. </li>
                <li> I had to let the wax cool in the fridge for around an hour before I could pour the next mold. But I am left with candles! </li>

 <h2>Brain Hurts </h2>
            <p> <h3>  This project is proving to be a true challenge for me. It really hightlights my inexperience in Rhino as I struggle to get, what feel like basic
components doing what I want. I decided that I wanted to make a candle mold that would make candles for my fire place candlabra. I wanted to add some mountains to it for a personal touch.
However, after measuring my size needs and getting in the base cylider that getting the mountains to extrude on the candle would be challeninging. I started in Illustrator to get my moutain vector. I tried follwoing along with the riboon video
but was not doing things quite right. I experimented with a number of things for a few hours and tried googling to kow avail. I didn't know what words to search. Thankfully we have the best
TA who aggreed to schedule a time to work on it with me. </h3> </p>

<p> I got a lot of help from Junchau both in getting the curve working and the wrapping my brain around how to make a mold, for a mold. He gave me a bunch of tips and ways to move things around
    which has been so helpful!I lost a my main candle mold, but thankfully we were able to make the the negatives I had created to make a mold. I first had created what my silicon mold should look like, instead of the mold to make it. I am going to print
    each mold half of a difreant printer to get it done on time. My school has a rule where we can't leave the printer running if no one is in the building. </p>
                <p> When I started my print I got a horrible sound from my printer as it tried to hone. I figured out that my Prusa gets unhappy about honeing if it is left at its highest postiion. I 
                    could adjust the y and it was good to go. </p>

<h3> Well I printed my molds at school, but quickly realized one my molds in is the negative, not the positive of what I wanted :( . Brain hurt!!! I can't fix it at work, but will work to fix it tomomrow after work. I believe I understand what I need
    to do to fix it, which is exciting. It means I am learning!!!</h2> </div>
