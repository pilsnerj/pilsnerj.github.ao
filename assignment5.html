            <h3> This was a fantastic learning project. I really enjoyed getting to use what I had learned to design the various components and that I could pull in some laser
              cutter work. I started this project first using the grasshopper script that we did in class, but I found it was not quite doing what I wanted yet. I watched the video that
              is posted in my previous page. I had to do a lot of adjusting on this one because the prongs going up would shake too much and get brittle and ugly. I did a couple of rounds of that, but ultimaltly needed to 
              make them wider. I could have added another support loops, but I did not like the look. Measuring the for the top loop to rest correctly went pretty well and I was able to accutatly measure for the rest of the loops on the thrid go. I did make one, that was way to big
              for my printer, so adjusted down from than. I made it through 11 interations! </P>
      <p> I started sketching some ideas to make my hanging lamp more of a desk lamp. You can see that sketch interaction in the video. Ultimatly I decided to make a gear lamp to go on my work desk since I am the the tech teacher. 
        I used a lamp image to create an SVG file for the laser printer.

      <p> Next I measured the cut outs of the cardboard gears to estimate what size my connecting tubes would need to be. I printed mini versions of the tubes until I got the sizes correct. The lamp did stand, but was a little rocky. 
        </P>
    <p> So I finished off the project by creating a base with inserts for the cardboard. Somehow I got the sizing correct on the first go, maybe measuring and printer estimates are getting better :). 
        And it worked!  I could wrap the cord around the tubes and it made for a stable base. I like it so much, I plan to order some black acrylic to make it look a bit
        more professional.

 <h2>Brain Hurts </h2>
            <p> <h3>  This project is proving to be a true challenge for me. It really hightlights my inexperience in Rhino as I struggle to get, what feel like basic
components doing what I want. I decided that I wanted to make a candle mold that would make candles for my fire place candlabra. I wanted to add some mountains to it for a personal touch.
However, after measuring my size needs and getting in the base cylider that getting the mountains to extrude on the candle would be challeninging. I started in Illustrator to get my moutain vector. I tried follwoing along with the riboon video
but was not doing things quite right. I experimented with a number of things for a few hours and tried googling to kow avail. I didn't know what words to search. Thankfully we have the best
TA who aggreed to schedule a time to work on it with me. </h3> </p>

<p> I got a lot of help from Junchau both in getting the curve working and the wrapping my brain around how to make a mold, for a mold. He gave me a bunch of tips and ways to move things around
    which has been so helpful!I lost a my main candle mold, but thankfully we were able to make the the negatives I had created to make a mold. I first had created what my silicon mold should look like, instead of the mold to make it. I am going to print
    each mold half of a difreant printer to get it done on time. My school has a rule where we can't leave the printer running if no one is in the building. </p>
                <p> When I started my print I got a horrible sound from my printer as it tried to hone. I figured out that my Prusa gets unhappy about honeing if it is left at its highest postiion. I 
                    could adjust the y and it was good to go. </p>
